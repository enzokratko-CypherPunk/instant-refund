# Instant Refund API

A lightweight FastAPI service that simulates and orchestrates **instant refund closeouts** for payment workflows.

This project is designed as a clean, minimal backend API that can:
- Accept refund requests
- Track refund state
- Provide deterministic responses for downstream systems
- Serve as a foundation for real payment rail integrations
